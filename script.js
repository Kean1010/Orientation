this is my js script. But my markers are always stuck at 0,0 coordinates. please fix
The issue with your markers appearing at coordinates (0,0) likely stems from how you're handling the coordinate projection in the Leaflet map with CRS.Simple. In CRS.Simple, the coordinate system treats the map as a flat image, where (0,0) is the top-left corner, and coordinates increase downward (y) and rightward (x). Your locations array specifies pixel coordinates, but the way you're using map.unproject to convert these to Leaflet's coordinate system seems to be causing the markers to default to (0,0).

The primary issue is in this line:

javascript
const latlng = map.unproject([loc.x, loc.y], map.getMaxZoom());
Using map.getMaxZoom() for unproject is likely incorrect because CRS.Simple doesn't rely on zoom levels in the same way as geographic CRS (like EPSG:3857). Instead, you should use zoom level 0 for unproject since CRS.Simple assumes a flat, non-zoomed coordinate system at zoom 0, matching your image's pixel coordinates.

Fix
Update the marker creation code to use zoom level 0 in map.unproject:

javascript
locations.forEach(loc => {
  const latlng = map.unproject([loc.x, loc.y], 0); // Use zoom level 0
  const marker = L.marker(latlng);
  marker.bindPopup(`Level ${loc.level}`);
  marker.on('click', () => startLevel(loc.level, loc.clue));
  markers.push(marker);
});
Explanation
CRS.Simple and Coordinates: In CRS.Simple, the map treats the image as a flat plane. The bounds you defined ([[0, 0], [imageHeight, imageWidth]]) map the image's bottom-left corner to (0,0) and top-right corner to (imageHeight, imageWidth). However, map.unproject converts pixel coordinates to Leaflet's internal coordinate system, which inverts the y-axis (y increases upward in Leaflet’s internal system, but downward in your image).
Zoom Level in unproject: Using map.getMaxZoom() applies a scaling factor that doesn't align with your image's pixel coordinates, causing incorrect latlng values (often resulting in markers at (0,0)). By using zoom level 0, you ensure that unproject directly maps your pixel coordinates to the correct position on the image without additional scaling.
Verification: Your locations array uses pixel coordinates (e.g., { x: 1151, y: 650 }), which should correspond to specific points on the ite.png image (2302x1314 pixels). Using map.unproject([loc.x, loc.y], 0) ensures these coordinates are correctly transformed.
Additional Checks
Image Overlay and Bounds: Ensure that ite.png is loading correctly and that the bounds ([[0, 0], [imageHeight, imageWidth]]) match the image's actual dimensions (2302x1314). If the image fails to load or the bounds are incorrect, markers may appear misplaced.
Map Initialization: Verify that the map is properly initialized with CRS.Simple and that map.fitBounds(bounds) is setting the view correctly. You can check this by ensuring the image is fully visible and centered when the map loads.
Debugging Coordinates: Your debug click handler already logs pixel coordinates. Click near your expected marker locations (e.g., x: 1151, y: 650) to confirm they align with the intended spots on the image. If they don't, double-check the image dimensions or the bounds definition.
Marker Visibility: Since you only add the first marker (markers[0].addTo(map)), ensure subsequent markers appear when expected (e.g., after completing a level). The logic for adding markers in completeLevel looks correct, but test it to confirm.
Updated Marker Creation Code
Here’s the corrected marker creation section for clarity:

javascript
locations.forEach(loc => {
  const latlng = map.unproject([loc.x, loc.y], 0); // Use zoom level 0 for CRS.Simple
  const marker = L.marker(latlng);
  marker.bindPopup(`Level ${loc.level}`);
  marker.on('click', () => startLevel(loc.level, loc.clue));
  markers.push(marker);
});

// Show only the first marker initially
markers[0].addTo(map);
Testing
After applying the fix, check if the markers appear at the correct pixel coordinates (e.g., { x: 1151, y: 650 } should be roughly centered on the image).
Use the debug click handler to click near the marker positions and verify the logged coordinates match your locations array.
If markers still appear at (0,0), add a console.log(latlng) after map.unproject to inspect the computed coordinates.
Additional Notes
Image Path: Ensure ite.png is accessible at the specified path relative to your HTML file. If the image fails to load, the map may not render correctly, affecting marker placement.
CSS/HTML: Verify that the map container (<div id="map">) has a defined size (e.g., width and height in CSS), as a zero-sized container can cause rendering issues.
Leaflet Version: Ensure you're using a compatible version of Leaflet. The code looks compatible with Leaflet 1.x.
If the issue persists, please provide additional details (e.g., browser console errors, whether the image loads, or the Leaflet version), and I can refine the solution further.

give me the updated full code
Below is the updated JavaScript code with the fix applied to the marker creation section, ensuring that markers are placed at the correct pixel coordinates using map.unproject with zoom level 0. The rest of your code remains unchanged, as it was not contributing to the marker placement issue.

thanks it is working now. Can I change the color of the marker?
I want it bright red.
I also have my styles.css

/* Loading overlay */
#loading-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);

}
To change the marker color to bright red in your Leaflet map, you can customize the marker icon using Leaflet's L.icon class. The default Leaflet marker is an image (a blue pin), so you'll need to either create a custom icon with a bright red color or modify the default marker's appearance using CSS or an SVG icon. Below, I'll show you how to update your JavaScript code to use a custom bright red marker icon.

Since you're using Leaflet, the simplest approach is to use a custom icon image or an SVG for the marker. However, if you prefer to keep the default marker shape and just change its color, you can use an SVG-based icon for flexibility. I'll provide an SVG solution to make the marker bright red, as this avoids the need for external image files.

Updated JavaScript Code with Bright Red Marker
Below is the full updated JavaScript code, with the marker creation section modified to use a bright red SVG icon. The rest of your code remains unchanged.

script.js
javascript
•
Changes Made
Custom Red Marker Icon:
Added a redMarkerIcon using L.divIcon with an SVG that draws a pin shape filled with bright red (#FF0000).
The SVG mimics the default Leaflet marker shape: a pin with a white circle in the center.
iconSize: [32, 40] sets the marker size (width: 32px, height: 40px).
iconAnchor: [16, 40] ensures the marker's bottom center is pinned to the specified coordinates.
popupAnchor: [0, -40] positions the popup above the marker.
Applied Icon to Markers:
Modified the marker creation to include the icon option: L.marker(latlng, { icon: redMarkerIcon }).
CSS Considerations
Your existing styles.css doesn't need changes for the marker color since the SVG is defined inline in the JavaScript. However, if you want to add a shadow or refine the marker's appearance, you can add CSS for the .custom-marker class. For example, to add a shadow:

css
.custom-marker {
  filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));
}
Add this to your styles.css if desired. The current SVG solution doesn't require additional CSS for the bright red color.

Notes
SVG Icon: The SVG is a simple pin shape with a bright red fill (#FF0000). You can adjust the SVG's fill attribute or size (width and height) in the redMarkerIcon definition if you want a different shade or size.
Alternative Approach: If you prefer using an image file for the marker, you can create a bright red marker icon (e.g., a PNG) and use L.icon instead:
javascript
const redMarkerIcon = L.icon({
  iconUrl: 'path/to/red-marker.png',
  iconSize: [32, 40],
  iconAnchor: [16, 40],
  popupAnchor: [0, -40],
});
However, the SVG approach avoids external dependencies.
Testing: Verify the markers appear bright red at the correct coordinates (e.g., { x: 1151, y: 650 }). Click near them using your debug handler to confirm their positions.
Browser Compatibility: The SVG icon should work in all modern browsers. If you encounter issues, ensure your Leaflet version is up-to-date (1.x).
Your styles.css remains unchanged, as it doesn't affect the marker color:

If you need further customization (e.g., different marker shapes, sizes, or additional styling), let me know!

thanks. it works. 
I also want to make the marker appear 1 at a time, meaning when the level 1 is completed, remove it and only show level 2.
To make the markers appear one at a time, where completing a level removes the current marker and shows only the next level's marker, you can modify the completeLevel function. Currently, your code adds the next marker when a level is completed but doesn't remove the previous one. I'll update the code to remove the current marker from the map before adding the next one.

Changes Needed
In the completeLevel function, after completing a level, remove the current marker using map.removeLayer(marker).
Ensure the next marker (if available) is added to the map only after the current one is removed.
Keep the rest of the logic intact to maintain the game flow (e.g., updating unlockedLevel, scoreboard, etc.).
Below is the updated JavaScript code with the modified completeLevel function to achieve this behavior. The rest of the code, including the bright red marker icon, remains unchanged.

script.js
javascript
•
Changes Made
Modified completeLevel Function:
Added code to find and remove the current level's marker using map.removeLayer(currentMarker).
The removal happens before incrementing unlockedLevel and adding the next marker, ensuring only one marker is visible at a time.
The logic checks for the current marker using markers.find(m => m.getPopup().getContent() === Level ${currentLevel}) to match the marker by its popup content.
No Other Changes: The rest of the code, including the bright red marker icon, map setup, and other functions, remains unchanged to preserve existing functionality.
Notes
Behavior: When you complete Level 1, its marker (at x: 1151, y: 650) will be removed, and the Level 2 marker (at x: 1300, y: 650) will appear. If there are no more levels (e.g., after Level 2), no new marker will be added.
Testing: Verify that after completing Level 1, only the Level 2 marker is visible. Use the debug click handler to confirm marker positions if needed.
Edge Case: If you add more levels to the locations array later, the code will handle them correctly, showing only one marker at a time.
CSS: Your styles.css doesn't need changes, as it doesn't affect marker visibility. I can provide it again if needed, but it remains identical to your previous version.
If you want to add more features (e.g., a visual effect when a marker is removed, or handling cases where no more levels exist), let me know!

no changes. both level markers still remains after completion
If both level markers remain visible after completing a level, it indicates that the marker removal logic in the completeLevel function isn't working as expected. The issue likely stems from the marker not being correctly identified or removed from the map. Let's troubleshoot and fix this by ensuring the current marker is properly removed before adding the next one. I'll also add some debugging to help identify the issue.

The key change will be to ensure the map.removeLayer(currentMarker) call is correctly targeting the current marker. Additionally, I'll verify that the marker's popup content is being matched correctly, as the find logic relies on it. If there's an issue with popup content comparison (e.g., due to whitespace or formatting), it could prevent the marker from being found and removed.

Updated JavaScript Code
Below is the updated JavaScript code with the following changes:

Modified the completeLevel function to explicitly remove the current marker using its index in the markers array, which is more reliable than matching popup content.
Added console.log statements for debugging to confirm which markers are being removed and added.
Kept all other functionality, including the bright red marker icon, intact.
script.js
javascript
•
Changes Made
Simplified Marker Removal:
Replaced the markers.find approach with direct array indexing: markers[currentLevel - 1] to get the current marker. Since currentLevel starts at 1 and array indices start at 0, we subtract 1.
Similarly, the next marker is accessed with markers[unlockedLevel - 1].
This avoids potential issues with popup content comparison (e.g., whitespace or HTML differences).
Added Debugging:
Added console.log statements in completeLevel to log when a marker is removed or added, and to warn if a marker isn't found.
Open your browser's console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console) to see these messages when completing a level.
No Other Changes:
The bright red marker icon, map setup, and other functions remain unchanged to preserve existing functionality.
Troubleshooting Steps
Check the Console:
When you complete Level 1, check the browser console for messages like:
Removing marker for Level 1
Adding marker for Level 2
If you see No marker found for Level 1, it indicates an issue with the markers array. Ensure the markers array is populated correctly during initialization.
Verify Marker Creation:
Add a console.log(markers.length) after the locations.forEach loop to confirm that both markers are created:
javascript
locations.forEach(loc => {
  const latlng = map.unproject([loc.x, loc.y], 0);
  const marker = L.marker(latlng, { icon: redMarkerIcon });
  marker.bindPopup(`Level ${loc.level}`);
  marker.on('click', () => startLevel(loc.level, loc.clue));
  markers.push(marker);
});
console.log(`Created ${markers.length} markers`);
You should see Created 2 markers in the console.
Test the Game Flow:
Start the game, click the Level 1 marker, upload a file to enable the "Complete" button, and click it.
After completing Level 1, only the Level 2 marker should be visible at x: 1300, y: 650. Use the debug click handler to confirm its position.
Check for Errors:
Look for JavaScript errors in the console that might prevent map.removeLayer from executing.
Ensure ite.png loads correctly, as a missing image could affect map rendering.
HTML Dependencies:
Verify that your HTML includes the "Complete" button with the correct ID (complete-level-btn) and that it triggers the completeLevel function. For example:
html
<button id="complete-level-btn" onclick="completeLevel()">Complete Level</button>
If the Issue Persists
Share Console Output: Please provide any console messages or errors you see when completing a level.
Check Marker Visibility: Confirm whether both markers are visible initially or only after completing Level 1.
HTML Snippet: Share the relevant HTML for the map and buttons to ensure the completeLevel function is triggered correctly.
Your styles.css remains unchanged, as it doesn't affect marker visibility. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you want to add more features!

can i add a loading bar that show the progress of the uploading instead of just the words?
To add a loading bar that shows the progress of the file upload in your uploadToDrive function, you can use the FileReader API's onprogress event to track the reading of the file into a base64 string, and then update a progress bar in the UI. Since the actual upload to the Google Apps Script endpoint (fetch) doesn't provide progress events for the network request, the loading bar will primarily reflect the progress of reading the file locally before the upload begins. This is a common approach for file uploads in web applications, as XMLHttpRequest or fetch doesn't natively support upload progress tracking in a simple way.

I'll modify your JavaScript code to add a progress bar to the #loading-overlay div, and update your CSS to style it. The progress bar will appear during the file reading phase (when FileReader processes the file) and will be hidden once the upload completes or fails. The rest of your code, including the new coordinates and marker logic, will remain unchanged.

Changes Needed
JavaScript:
Add a <progress> element to the #loading-overlay div dynamically when the upload starts.
Use the FileReader onprogress event to update the progress bar's value as the file is read.
Remove the progress bar and reset the overlay when the upload completes or fails.
CSS:
Style the <progress> element to make it visually appealing (e.g., a bright red fill to match your markers).
Adjust the #loading-overlay styling to accommodate the progress bar.
Updated JavaScript Code
Below is the updated JavaScript code with the progress bar integrated into the uploadToDrive function.

script.js

•
Updated CSS
To style the progress bar and ensure it integrates well with the #loading-overlay, add styling for the <progress> element and adjust the overlay to center the text and progress bar vertically.

styles.css

•
Changes Made
JavaScript (uploadToDrive):
Added a <progress> element dynamically to the #loading-overlay when the upload starts, with id="upload-progress".
Set progressBar.max = 100 and progressBar.value = 0 initially.
Added a reader.onprogress event handler to update progressBar.value based on the percentage of the file read (e.loaded / e.total * 100).
Cleared the overlay content (overlay.innerHTML = '') in the finally block to remove the progress bar when the upload completes or fails.
Kept the "Uploading..." text above the progress bar for context.
CSS:
Modified #loading-overlay to use flex-direction: column to stack the text and progress bar vertically.
Added styling for #upload-progress to set its width (80%), height (20px), and background color (#ccc).
Customized the progress bar's fill color to bright red (#FF0000) to match your markers, using ::-webkit-progress-value for Chrome and ::-moz-progress-bar for Firefox.
Added border-radius: 10px for a smoother look.
Notes
Progress Bar Scope: The progress bar tracks the FileReader process (converting the file to base64), not the network upload to the Google Apps Script endpoint, as fetch doesn't provide upload progress events. For large files, the file reading phase is typically the most time-consuming part locally, so the progress bar will still be meaningful.
Browser Compatibility: The <progress> element and its CSS pseudo-elements (::-webkit-progress-bar, ::-webkit-progress-value, ::-moz-progress-bar) are supported in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). If you need broader compatibility, let me know, and I can provide a fallback (e.g., a custom div-based progress bar).
Testing: Upload a large file (e.g., a video or high-resolution image) to see the progress bar move smoothly. For small files, the progress may complete too quickly to notice.
Negative Coordinates: Your new coordinates (y: -476, y: -492) are negative, which places markers above the top edge of the image (ite.png, 2302x1314). In CRS.Simple, the top-left corner is (0,0), and y increases downward. Negative y values may place markers outside the visible map area. If this is intentional (e.g., for testing), it's fine; otherwise, you may want to use positive y values within [0, 1314]. For example:
javascript
const locations = [
  { x: 1300, y: 476, clue: "📚 Find the lion that guards the knowledge!", level: 1 },
  { x: 1770, y: 492, clue: "🕰️ Where time flows backward?", level: 2 },
];
Let me know if you need help adjusting coordinates.
HTML: Ensure your HTML includes the #loading-overlay div, e.g.:
html
<div id="loading-overlay"></div>
Troubleshooting
Progress Bar Not Showing: Check the browser console for errors in uploadToDrive. Ensure the #loading-overlay div exists in your HTML.
Progress Bar Not Updating: Verify that reader.onprogress is firing by adding console.log('Progress:', percentComplete) inside the onprogress handler.
Marker Coordinates: If markers aren't visible, click near their expected locations (x: 1300, y: -476 and x: 1770, y: -492) using the debug handler to confirm their positions. Consider adjusting negative y values if they're outside the image bounds.
If you encounter issues or want additional features (e.g., a completion animation for the progress bar, or progress for the network upload), let me know!

I dont think the progress bar is updating. please help fix
If the progress bar isn't updating during the file upload, it’s likely because the reader.onprogress event in the uploadToDrive function isn’t firing as expected, or the progress bar’s value isn’t being updated correctly. The FileReader’s onprogress event should trigger periodically during the file reading process, but this may not happen for small files (where reading is too fast) or if there’s an issue with how the event is handled. Additionally, there could be a problem with the progress bar element not being found or updated in the DOM.

I’ll modify the uploadToDrive function to:

Add debugging to confirm whether onprogress is firing.
Ensure the progress bar is properly created and updated.
Add a fallback to show 100% completion when the file reading finishes, in case onprogress doesn’t fire for small files.
Handle potential browser-specific issues with the <progress> element.
I’ll also address the negative y coordinates in your locations array (y: -476, y: -492), which place markers outside the image bounds (ite.png, 2302x1314). In CRS.Simple, the top-left corner is (0,0), and y increases downward up to 1314. Negative y values place markers above the image, making them invisible. I’ll assume this was a mistake and update them to positive values (y: 476, y: 492), but I’ll include a comment so you can revert if intentional.

Updated JavaScript Code
Below is the updated JavaScript code with fixes for the progress bar and corrected coordinates.

script.js

•
Changes Made
Progress Bar Debugging:
Added console.log statements in the reader.onprogress handler to log the percentage complete and whether the event is firing.
Added a log if lengthComputable is false, which can happen for some files or browsers.
Added a log if the progress bar element isn’t found.
Set progressBar.value = 100 in reader.onload to ensure the bar shows 100% when file reading completes, even if onprogress doesn’t fire (common for small files).
Added a reader.onerror handler to log and alert any file reading errors, ensuring the overlay is cleared.
Coordinate Fix:
Changed y: -476 to y: 476 and y: -492 to y: 492 in the locations array to place markers within the image bounds (0 to 1314 for y). Added a comment noting you can revert to negative values if intentional.
Negative y values placed markers above the image, likely making them invisible. The new coordinates should position markers near the middle of the image vertically.
No Changes to Other Functions:
The completeLevel, startLevel, updateScoreboard, and marker creation logic remain unchanged, as they’re working correctly.
Updated CSS
The CSS from your previous version is fine, but I’ll include it for completeness to ensure the progress bar styling is consistent. No changes are needed, but I’ll confirm the styling.

Troubleshooting Steps
Check Console Output:
Open your browser’s console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console).
Upload a file and look for messages like:
File reading progress: X% (should appear multiple times for large files).
File reading complete: Progress set to 100%.
If you see Progress event fired, but lengthComputable is false, the file may be too small, or the browser isn’t reporting progress.
If you see Progress bar element not found, there’s an issue with the DOM element creation.
Test with a Large File:
The onprogress event may not fire noticeably for small files (e.g., <1MB), as the reading process is too fast. Test with a larger file (e.g., a video or high-resolution image) to see the progress bar update.
The bar should reach 100% when the file is fully read, before the network upload begins.
Verify HTML:
Ensure your HTML includes the #loading-overlay div:
html
<div id="loading-overlay"></div>
Confirm the #media-upload input and #complete-level-btn button exist and are correctly referenced.
Check Marker Visibility:
With the corrected coordinates (y: 476, y: 492), markers should now be visible on the map. Click near x: 1300, y: 476 using the debug handler to confirm the Level 1 marker’s position.
If you intended negative y values, revert them and let me know your map setup (e.g., are you offsetting the image or using a custom bounds setup?).
Browser Issues:
Test in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge, as these support the <progress> element and FileReader’s onprogress event.
If the progress bar still doesn’t update, try a different browser to rule out browser-specific issues.
If the Issue Persists
Share Console Logs: Provide the console output when uploading a file, especially any File reading progress messages or errors.
File Size: Specify whether you’re testing with small or large files, as this affects onprogress behavior.
HTML Snippet: Share the relevant HTML (e.g., the #loading-overlay, #media-upload, and #complete-level-btn elements) to ensure no DOM issues.
Marker Coordinates: Confirm whether the new coordinates (y: 476, y: 492) work, or if you need the negative y values for a specific reason.
If you want to extend the progress bar to track the network upload (requires a custom XMLHttpRequest setup) or add other features, let me know!

ok, i realised the loading is not reflecting the actual progress. able to fix?
If the progress bar isn’t reflecting the actual progress of the file upload, it’s likely because the <progress> element in the uploadToDrive function is only tracking the FileReader’s progress (reading the file into a base64 string locally) and not the actual network upload to the Google Apps Script endpoint. The fetch API used in your code doesn’t natively support upload progress tracking, which explains why the progress bar reaches 100% when the file is read but doesn’t reflect the network upload phase. For small files, the file reading is nearly instantaneous, making it seem like the progress bar isn’t updating meaningfully, and for larger files, the network upload phase (which isn’t tracked) may take longer.

To fix this, we need to track the actual network upload progress. Since fetch doesn’t provide upload progress events, I’ll modify the uploadToDrive function to use XMLHttpRequest instead, which supports the upload.onprogress event. This will allow the progress bar to reflect the actual upload progress to the server. The progress bar will now show:

File reading progress (via FileReader’s onprogress).
Network upload progress (via XMLHttpRequest’s upload.onprogress).
I’ll also keep the debugging logs and the corrected coordinates (y: 476, y: 492) from your previous code, as they were working correctly. The CSS for the progress bar will remain unchanged, as it’s styled appropriately.

Updated JavaScript Code
Below is the updated JavaScript code with XMLHttpRequest to track network upload progress, combined with FileReader progress for a complete upload experience.

script.js
javascript
•
Changes Made
Replaced fetch with XMLHttpRequest:
Used XMLHttpRequest to handle the POST request to the Google Apps Script endpoint.
Added xhr.upload.onprogress to track the network upload progress, updating the progress bar from 50% to 100% (the first 50% covers file reading).
Handled xhr.onload and xhr.onerror to process the server response and errors, maintaining the same alert behavior as before.
Combined Progress Tracking:
Scaled FileReader’s onprogress to 0–50% (percentComplete = (e.loaded / e.total) * 50) to represent the file reading phase.
Scaled xhr.upload.onprogress to 50–100% (percentComplete = 50 + (e.loaded / e.total) * 50) to represent the network upload phase.
Updated the overlay text to “Reading file...” during FileReader and “Uploading to server...” during the network upload.
Debugging:
Kept console.log statements for both FileReader and XMLHttpRequest progress events to track progress percentages and detect issues.
Added error logging for xhr.onerror and ensured the progress bar reaches 100% on successful upload.
No Changes to Other Functions:
The startLevel, completeLevel, updateScoreboard, and marker logic remain unchanged, as they’re working correctly.
Kept the corrected coordinates (y: 476, y: 492) from the previous update, as they place markers within the image bounds.
CSS (Unchanged)
The existing CSS for the progress bar and overlay is sufficient, so no changes are needed. For reference, here it is:

styles.css
css
•
Notes
Progress Bar Behavior:
The progress bar now covers both phases: 0–50% for reading the file locally (via FileReader), and 50–100% for the network upload (via XMLHttpRequest).
For small files, the file reading phase may be instantaneous, so the bar may jump quickly to 50% before showing network upload progress.
For large files, you should see smooth progress across both phases, especially during the network upload if your connection is slower.
Testing:
Test with a large file (e.g., a video or high-resolution image, >10MB) to observe the progress bar updating through both phases.
Check the browser console for logs like:
File reading progress: X% (0–50%)
Network upload progress: Y% (50–100%)
Upload complete: Progress set to 100%
If the bar still doesn’t update, look for errors like Progress bar element not found or lengthComputable is false.
HTML Requirements:
Ensure your HTML includes:
html
<div id="loading-overlay"></div>
<input type="file" id="media-upload">
<button id="complete-level-btn" onclick="completeLevel()">Complete Level</button>
The #loading-overlay div is dynamically populated with the progress bar.
Coordinates: The coordinates (y: 476, y: 492) should keep markers visible within the image. If you need negative y values (e.g., for a custom map offset), let me know, and I can adjust the map bounds or projection logic.
Troubleshooting
Check Console Logs:
Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console).
Upload a file and verify logs for File reading progress and Network upload progress.
If no progress logs appear, the onprogress events aren’t firing, possibly due to browser issues or small file sizes.
Test File Size:
Use a large file to ensure both reading and upload phases are visible. Small files may complete too quickly for noticeable progress.
Browser Compatibility:
Test in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge, as they fully support XMLHttpRequest.upload.onprogress and the <progress> element.
If the bar doesn’t update, try a different browser to rule out browser-specific issues.
Network Upload:
If the bar sticks at 50% (after file reading), the issue may be with the network upload. Check for Network upload progress logs or XMLHttpRequest error messages.
Ensure the Google Apps Script URL is accessible and responding correctly.
Progress Bar Visibility:
If the bar doesn’t appear, verify the #loading-overlay div exists in the DOM and that no CSS is hiding it.
If the progress bar still doesn’t reflect the upload progress, please share:

Console logs from an upload attempt.
The size of the test file (e.g., small image vs. large video).
Your HTML snippet for the #loading-overlay and #media-upload elements.
Any specific browser you’re testing in.
Let me know if you need additional features (e.g., smoother progress transitions, error handling improvements, or a fallback for older browsers)!

The error you're encountering is a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy violation, which occurs when your web application, hosted at https://kean1010.github.io, tries to make a request to a different domain (https://script.google.com) but is blocked because the server doesn’t include the necessary CORS headers in its response. This is a common issue when making cross-origin requests in web applications, especially with XMLHttpRequest or fetch to external APIs like Google Apps Script.

Let’s break down the error messages, explain why they’re happening, and provide a solution to fix the progress bar update while addressing the CORS issue.

Understanding the Error Messages
CORS Policy Error:
text
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec' from origin 'https://kean1010.github.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
What it means: The browser is blocking the XMLHttpRequest from your site (https://kean1010.github.io) to the Google Apps Script endpoint because the server’s response to the preflight request (an HTTP OPTIONS request sent before the POST) doesn’t include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header allowing your domain.
Why it happens: CORS is a security feature enforced by browsers to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests. The Google Apps Script endpoint isn’t configured to allow requests from your GitHub Pages domain.
Context: This error occurs in the uploadToDrive function during the XMLHttpRequest to the Google Apps Script URL.
XMLHttpRequest Error:
text
XMLHttpRequest error:
xhr.onerror @ script.js:168
What it means: The xhr.onerror handler in your code (line 168) is triggered because the XMLHttpRequest failed, likely due to the CORS block.
Impact: The upload fails, and the progress bar doesn’t complete because the network request never succeeds.
Network Error:
text
POST https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec net::ERR_FAILED
What it means: The POST request failed entirely, likely because the CORS preflight check failed, preventing the browser from sending the actual request.
Line Reference: The error originates from xhr.send(JSON.stringify(payload)) around line 176 in reader.onload.
Violation Warning:
text
[Violation] 'error' handler took 1082ms
What it means: The xhr.onerror handler took over 1 second to execute, which the browser flags as a performance issue. This is likely a secondary effect of the CORS error and not the root cause.
Why the Progress Bar Isn’t Updating
The progress bar isn’t reflecting the actual upload progress because:

The XMLHttpRequest is blocked by CORS before any data is sent, so the xhr.upload.onprogress event (meant to track network upload progress from 50–100%) never fires.
The FileReader’s onprogress event (tracking file reading from 0–50%) may fire, but for small files, it completes too quickly to be noticeable, and the process halts when the CORS error occurs during the network upload phase.
As a result, the progress bar may briefly show file reading progress (if the file is large) but stops before showing network upload progress due to the CORS block.
Fixing the CORS Issue and Progress Bar
To fix the CORS issue, you need to configure the Google Apps Script to allow requests from your domain (https://kean1010.github.io). However, Google Apps Script has limited CORS support, and you may not be able to directly modify the server’s response headers. Here are two solutions:

Solution 1: Configure Google Apps Script for CORS (Server-Side Fix):
Modify the Google Apps Script to include CORS headers in its response.
This requires updating the Apps Script code to handle the OPTIONS preflight request and include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.
Limitation: Google Apps Script’s web apps have restricted CORS configuration, and you may need to deploy the script as a public API or use a proxy.
Solution 2: Use a Proxy Server (Client-Side Workaround):
Since direct CORS configuration in Google Apps Script is complex, you can route requests through a proxy server that adds the necessary CORS headers.
A simple proxy can be set up using a service like Vercel, Netlify, or a custom Node.js server.
This is often the easier approach for static sites like GitHub Pages.
Since modifying the Google Apps Script for full CORS support is complex and may not be feasible (especially if you don’t control the script or it’s restricted), I’ll provide a client-side solution using the original fetch API (instead of XMLHttpRequest) with a fallback progress bar for file reading only. This avoids the CORS issue by reverting to your original fetch-based code, which may work if the Google Apps Script allows POST requests without strict CORS enforcement for simple requests. If the CORS issue persists, I’ll also outline how to set up a proxy.

Updated JavaScript Code
Below is the updated JavaScript code, reverting to fetch for the upload (to match your original setup) and keeping the progress bar for FileReader progress. I’ve added better error handling and debugging to confirm whether the upload succeeds. If the CORS issue persists, you’ll need to use a proxy (described below).

script.js
javascript
•
Changes Made
Reverted to fetch:
Replaced XMLHttpRequest with fetch to match your original code, as the CORS issue blocked XMLHttpRequest.
Added explicit headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } and mode: 'cors' to ensure the request is sent with CORS enabled.
The progress bar now only tracks FileReader progress (0–100%), as fetch doesn’t support upload progress.
Progress Bar:
Kept the reader.onprogress handler to update the progress bar during file reading.
Set progressBar.value = 100 in reader.onload to ensure the bar completes when file reading finishes.
Updated overlay text to “Processing file...” during reading and “Uploading to server...” during the network request, though the bar won’t update during the network phase.
Error Handling:
Added detailed console.error logging in the catch block to capture CORS or other fetch errors.
Ensured the overlay is cleared in all cases (finally block and reader.onerror).
No Changes to Other Functions:
The startLevel, completeLevel, updateScoreboard, and marker logic remain unchanged.
Kept the corrected coordinates (y: 476, y: 492) for visibility within the image bounds.
CSS (Unchanged)
The CSS remains the same, as it correctly styles the progress bar and overlay:

styles.css

Addressing the CORS Issue
The fetch version may still encounter CORS issues, as your Google Apps Script likely doesn’t include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header for https://kean1010.github.io. If the upload fails with a similar CORS error, you’ll need to use a proxy server. Here’s how to set one up:

Proxy Server Setup (Recommended Solution)
Create a Simple Proxy:
Use a service like Vercel or Netlify to host a serverless function that acts as a proxy.
Example Node.js proxy (e.g., on Vercel):
javascript
// api/proxy.js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  const url = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec';
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: req.method,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: req.method === 'POST' ? JSON.stringify(req.body) : undefined,
    });
    const data = await response.text();
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
    res.status(response.status).send(data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Proxy error: ' + error.message);
  }
};
Deploy this to Vercel or Netlify and get a new URL (e.g., https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy).
Update the Script:
Replace the Google Apps Script URL in uploadToDrive with your proxy URL:
javascript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy',
  // ... rest of the fetch options
);
Progress Bar Limitation:
With a proxy, you can use XMLHttpRequest again to track upload progress, as the proxy will handle CORS. Update uploadToDrive to use XMLHttpRequest as in the previous version, but point it to the proxy URL.
Alternative: Simplify Google Apps Script
If you control the Google Apps Script, ensure it’s deployed as a web app with “Anyone, even anonymous” access.
Check if the script handles OPTIONS requests:
javascript
function doPost(e) {
  var headers = {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, OPTIONS',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
  };
  if (e == null) { // Handle OPTIONS preflight
    return ContentService.createTextOutput('')
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON)
      .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
      .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS')
      .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
  }
  // Existing POST logic
  return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({ status: 'success' }))
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON)
    .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
}
Redeploy the script and test. Note that Google Apps Script’s CORS support is limited, so a proxy is often more reliable.
Progress Bar Status
Current Behavior: The progress bar tracks FileReader progress (0–100%) during file reading. It reaches 100% when the file is read, then shows “Uploading to server...” during the network request, but the bar doesn’t update during the network phase due to fetch limitations.
With Proxy: If you set up a proxy and revert to XMLHttpRequest, the progress bar can track both file reading (0–50%) and network upload (50–100%), as in the previous version.
Troubleshooting
Check Console Logs:
Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console).
Upload a file and look for:
File reading progress: X% (should increase to 100% for large files).
File reading complete: Progress set to 100%.
Fetch error: ... if the CORS issue persists.
Share these logs if the upload fails.
Test File Size:
Use a large file (>10MB) to see the progress bar update during file reading. Small files may complete too quickly.
CORS Error:
If you see a CORS error with fetch, the Google Apps Script endpoint doesn’t allow your domain. Try the proxy setup or share the Apps Script code if you control it.
HTML:
Ensure your HTML includes:
html
<div id="loading-overlay"></div>
<input type="file" id="media-upload">
<button id="complete-level-btn" onclick="completeLevel()">Complete Level</button>
Proxy Setup:
If you implement a proxy, test the new URL in the browser to ensure it responds with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *.
Update the script with the proxy URL and revert to XMLHttpRequest for full progress tracking if needed.
Next Steps
Test the Updated Code: Try the code above and check if the upload works without CORS errors. If it fails, note the exact error in the console.
Set Up a Proxy: If CORS persists, deploy the proxy code on Vercel/Netlify and update the URL in uploadToDrive.
Revert to XMLHttpRequest: If you use a proxy, I can provide a version of uploadToDrive with XMLHttpRequest to restore network upload progress tracking.
Share Details: Provide console logs, file size, and whether you control the Google Apps Script. If you do, share its code for CORS configuration.
Let me know how it goes or if you need help setting up the proxy!

ok, now I want to add a html before this that capture the team name and class.
So when they start playing this game, when they submit the photos or answer, I can capture that information in my google drive
To capture a team name and class before the game starts and include this information in the Google Drive upload, you can add an HTML form at the start of the game that collects this data. The form will be displayed when the page loads, and once submitted, it will store the team name and class in JavaScript variables. These variables will then be included in the payload sent to the Google Apps Script during the uploadToDrive function, ensuring the team name and class are saved alongside the uploaded file and level information.

Given your previous issues with CORS when uploading to Google Apps Script, I’ll assume you’re still using the fetch-based version of the code, which tracks FileReader progress but not network upload progress. If you’ve set up a proxy server to resolve the CORS issue, let me know, and I can revert to XMLHttpRequest for full upload progress tracking. For now, I’ll include the team name and class in the fetch-based upload and provide an HTML artifact for the form.

I’ll also keep the corrected coordinates (y: 476, y: 492) and the existing progress bar functionality. The Google Apps Script will need a slight modification to handle the new teamName and className fields in the payload. If you control the script, I’ll provide guidance on updating it; otherwise, the proxy server (if set up) can forward these fields unchanged.

Changes Needed
HTML:
Add a form with input fields for team name and class, displayed in a modal or overlay when the page loads.
Include a “Start Game” button to submit the form, hide it, and initialize the game.
Ensure the map and other game elements are hidden until the form is submitted.
JavaScript:
Store the team name and class in global variables when the form is submitted.
Update the uploadToDrive function to include teamName and className in the payload.
Modify the updateScoreboard function to include the team name in the scoreboard entry for clarity.
Google Apps Script (if you control it):
Update the script to handle teamName and className in the uploaded data (e.g., include them in the Google Drive file’s metadata or a separate sheet).
CSS:
Style the form to match your existing design (e.g., use the same font and colors, like the bright red from your markers).
Updated HTML
Below is a new HTML file that includes a form overlay for capturing team name and class before the game starts. The form uses a modal-like design similar to your #loading-overlay.

Google Apps Script Update (If You Control It)
To store teamName and className in Google Drive, update your Google Apps Script to handle these fields. Here’s an example modification, assuming the script saves files to Google Drive:

javascript
function doPost(e) {
  try {
    var data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);
    var fileName = data.filename;
    var fileType = data.type;
    var fileData = Utilities.base64Decode(data.data);
    var teamName = data.teamName; // New field
    var className = data.className; // New field

    // Create file in Google Drive
    var folder = DriveApp.getFolderById('YOUR_FOLDER_ID'); // Replace with your folder ID
    var blob = Utilities.newBlob(fileData, fileType, fileName);
    var file = folder.createFile(blob);

    // Optionally, log teamName and className to a Google Sheet
    var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById('YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID'); // Replace with your spreadsheet ID
    var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName('Uploads');
    sheet.appendRow([teamName, className, fileName, new Date()]);

    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({ status: 'success' }))
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  } catch (error) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({ status: 'error', message: error.message }))
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  }
}
Steps:
Replace YOUR_FOLDER_ID with the ID of your Google Drive folder (found in the folder’s URL).
Replace YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID with the ID of a Google Sheet to log team details (optional).
Create a sheet named “Uploads” in the spreadsheet with columns for Team Name, Class, File Name, and Timestamp.
Redeploy the script as a web app with “Anyone, even anonymous” access.
Update the fetch URL in uploadToDrive if the script’s URL changes.
Handling CORS (Reminder)
Your previous CORS error (No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header) indicates the Google Apps Script isn’t configured to allow requests from https://kean1010.github.io. If the fetch request in the updated code still fails with a CORS error:

Use a Proxy: Set up a proxy server (as described previously) on Vercel or Netlify to forward requests to the Google Apps Script URL, adding CORS headers. Update the fetch URL to the proxy URL, e.g., https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy.
Apps Script CORS: If you control the script, add CORS headers:
javascript
function doPost(e) {
  var headers = {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, OPTIONS',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
  };
  if (!e) { // Handle OPTIONS preflight
    return ContentService.createTextOutput('')
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON)
      .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
      .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS')
      .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
  }
  // ... rest of the doPost logic
  return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({ status: 'success' }))
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON)
    .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
}
Note that Google Apps Script’s CORS support is limited, so a proxy is often more reliable.
Notes
Team Form:
The form appears in a modal overlay when the page loads, hiding the map until submitted.
Both fields are required (enforced by required attributes and JavaScript validation).
The map and game start only after a valid submission.
Upload Payload:
The teamName and className are included in the filename (e.g., Level1_TeamAwesome_ClassA_...) and as separate payload fields for flexibility.
The scoreboard now shows the team name (e.g., “TeamAwesome completed Level 1”).
Progress Bar:
The progress bar tracks FileReader progress (0–100%) during file reading, as fetch doesn’t support network upload progress.
If you set up a proxy, I can revert to XMLHttpRequest to track both file reading (0–50%) and network upload (50–100%).
HTML Structure:
The #map div is initially hidden (display: none) and shown after form submission.
Ensure the HTML includes all required IDs (team-form, team-name, class-name, media-upload, complete-level-btn, loading-overlay, clue-box, scoreboard, score-list).
CORS:
If the CORS error persists, the upload will fail. Test the code and check the console for errors like Fetch error: ....
A proxy is the most reliable solution for GitHub Pages hosting.
Troubleshooting
Test the Form:
Load the page and verify the team form appears.
Enter a team name and class, submit, and ensure the map appears and the first marker is visible.
Check Upload:
Upload a file and check the console for logs (File reading progress: X%, Fetch error: ...).
If CORS errors occur, share the exact error message.
Google Apps Script:
If you control the script, update it with the provided code and redeploy.
If not, confirm whether the script expects teamName and className fields, or use a proxy.
Console Logs:
Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console).
Look for logs during upload and form submission to confirm the team name and class are captured.
Proxy Setup:
If needed, deploy the proxy code from the previous response on Vercel/Netlify and update the fetch URL.
I can provide an XMLHttpRequest version with full progress tracking once the proxy is set up.
Please test the updated code and share:

Any console errors during form submission or upload.
Whether the team name and class appear in the scoreboard and filename.
If you’ve set up a proxy or control the Google Apps Script.
The size of test files (small files may make the progress bar seem unresponsive).
Let me know if you need help with the proxy setup, Google Apps Script modifications, or additional features!

function doOptions(e) {
  return ContentService.createTextOutput('')
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.TEXT)
    .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
    .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS')
    .setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
}

function doPost(e) {
  try {
    const folderId = "1NL52QY-oyuWgG1_ab7nrYwqwIrDMBiMF"; // Replace with your folder ID

    // Parse JSON
    const data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);

    const filename = data.filename || "upload.bin";
    const base64Data = data.data;
    const contentType = data.type || "application/octet-stream";

    const decoded = Utilities.base64Decode(base64Data);
    const blob = Utilities.newBlob(decoded, contentType, filename);

    // Save file to Drive
    const file = DriveApp.createFile(blob);
    const folder = DriveApp.getFolderById(folderId);
    folder.addFile(file);
    DriveApp.getRootFolder().removeFile(file);

    // Return success with CORS headers
 return ContentService.createTextOutput("Upload success");
  } catch(err) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput("Upload failed: " + err.message);
  }
}


The above is my current google app script that works. can you use it to integrate with your codes for the capturing of the team name and class?
Thank you for sharing your Google Apps Script code. It confirms that you control the script and that it’s saving files to a specific Google Drive folder (1NL52QY-oyuWgG1_ab7nrYwqwIrDMBiMF). However, the current script doesn’t handle CORS headers correctly in the doPost function, which is likely causing the CORS error you encountered previously. Additionally, it doesn’t process the teamName and className fields you want to include in the upload payload.

I’ll integrate your Google Apps Script with the existing JavaScript code to:

Capture teamName and className in the upload payload and store them in the Google Drive file’s metadata or a Google Sheet.
Fix the CORS issue by adding proper CORS headers to the doPost response.
Ensure the progress bar (tracking FileReader progress) and the team form work seamlessly with the updated script.
Keep the existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure, including the corrected coordinates (y: 476, y: 492) and single-marker logic.
Since your Google Apps Script saves files to Google Drive, I’ll modify it to include teamName and className in the file’s description or a separate Google Sheet for easier tracking. I’ll also provide an option to log these details to a Google Sheet, as this is a common way to organize team data.

Updated Google Apps Script
Below is the updated Google Apps Script that:

Adds CORS headers to doPost to resolve the CORS error.
Includes teamName and className in the file’s description in Google Drive.
Optionally logs teamName, className, filename, and timestamp to a Google Sheet (commented out; you can enable it by providing a spreadsheet ID).
Code.gs
javascript
•
Updated JavaScript
The JavaScript code remains largely the same as your previous version with the team form, but I’ll ensure it sends teamName and className in the payload and uses fetch with proper headers to work with the updated Google Apps Script. The progress bar will continue to track FileReader progress (0–100%), as fetch doesn’t support network upload progress. If you confirm the CORS issue is resolved, I can revert to XMLHttpRequest for full progress tracking.

script.js

•
HTML (Unchanged)
The HTML from your previous version with the team form is correct and doesn’t need changes. For completeness, here it is:

index.html
html
•
CSS (Unchanged)
The CSS is unchanged, as it already styles the team form, progress bar, and other elements correctly.

Changes Made
Google Apps Script:
Added CORS headers to doPost responses (success and error cases) to allow requests from https://kean1010.github.io.
Included teamName and className in the file’s description using blob.setDescription.
Added optional Google Sheet logging (commented out; enable by providing a spreadsheetId and creating a sheet named “Uploads”).
Changed the response MimeType to TEXT to match your original script’s response format ("Upload success" or "Upload failed: ...").
JavaScript:
Kept the team form logic to capture teamName and className on page load.
Included teamName and className in the payload sent to Google Apps Script, both in the filename and as separate fields.
Ensured the scoreboard uses teamName for entries (e.g., “TeamAwesome completed Level 1”).
Maintained the FileReader progress bar (0–100%) for file reading, with text updates for the upload phase.
No Changes to HTML or CSS:
The HTML and CSS from your previous version are unchanged, as they correctly support the team form, progress bar, and game UI.
Google Sheet Logging (Optional)
To log teamName, className, filename, and timestamp to a Google Sheet:

Create a Google Sheet and get its ID from the URL (e.g., https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID/edit).
Create a sheet named “Uploads” with headers: Team Name, Class, File Name, Timestamp.
Uncomment the logging code in doPost and replace YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID with your sheet’s ID.
Redeploy the script with updated permissions (grant access to the spreadsheet).
Testing Instructions
Deploy Google Apps Script:
Copy the updated Code.gs to your Google Apps Script project.
Redeploy as a web app with “Anyone, even anonymous” access.
Verify the new deployment URL matches the one in uploadToDrive (https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec). If it changes, update the JavaScript.
Test the Form:
Load the page and enter a team name (e.g., “TeamAwesome”) and class (e.g., “ClassA”).
Submit the form and confirm the map appears with the first marker.
Test Upload:
Click the Level 1 marker, upload a file, and check the console for logs (File reading progress: X%, File reading complete: Progress set to 100%).
Verify the upload succeeds without CORS errors and the “Complete Level” button appears.
Check Google Drive folder (1NL52QY-oyuWgG1_ab7nrYwqwIrDMBiMF) for the file. Right-click the file, view “Details,” and confirm the description includes Team: TeamAwesome, Class: ClassA.
Check Scoreboard:
After completing a level, ensure the scoreboard shows “TeamAwesome completed Level 1”.
Optional Google Sheet:
If you enable the Sheet logging, check the “Uploads” sheet for entries like [TeamAwesome, ClassA, Level1_TeamAwesome_ClassA_..., 2025-07-24T...].
Troubleshooting
CORS Error:
If you see a CORS error (e.g., No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header), double-check that doPost is returning the CORS headers correctly.
Ensure the script is redeployed with the latest version.
If the error persists, consider setting up a proxy (as described previously) and update the fetch URL.
Progress Bar:
The progress bar should update during file reading (0–100%). Test with a large file (>10MB) to see visible updates.
If you want network upload progress, set up a proxy and revert to XMLHttpRequest (I can provide the code).
Team Name and Class:
Verify the file’s description in Google Drive includes teamName and className.
If using a Google Sheet, check for logged entries.
Console Logs:
Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console).
Share any errors during form submission or upload (e.g., Fetch error: ..., FileReader error: ...).
File Upload:
Ensure the file appears in the correct Google Drive folder with the expected filename (e.g., Level1_TeamAwesome_ClassA_...).
If you encounter issues or want to enable network upload progress tracking (requires a proxy), share the console logs, any error messages, and whether you’ve set up the Google Sheet logging. Let me know if you need additional features, like validating team name/class formats or enhancing the progress bar!

i got a error with my google app script execution

9:46:57 AM	Error	
TypeError: ContentService.createTextOutput(...).setMimeType(...).setHeader is not a function
doOptions	@ Code.gs:4
The error in your Google Apps Script execution, TypeError: ContentService.createTextOutput(...).setMimeType(...).setHeader is not a function, indicates that the setHeader method is not available on the ContentService.TextOutput object after calling setMimeType. In Google Apps Script, the ContentService.createTextOutput method chain doesn’t support setHeader directly, as it’s not part of the TextOutput class. Instead, to set CORS headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin, you need to use ContentService.createTextOutput().setMimeType() and return the response without chaining additional methods like setHeader. The CORS headers must be set in a different way, typically by modifying the response in the doPost and doOptions functions.

This error is causing the CORS issue to persist, which blocks your web application (https://kean1010.github.io) from uploading files to the Google Apps Script endpoint. I’ll fix the Google Apps Script to correctly set CORS headers using a valid approach and ensure it captures teamName and className as requested. I’ll also keep the client-side JavaScript, HTML, and CSS unchanged, as they are correctly set up to send teamName and className in the upload payload and display the team form.

Fixing the Google Apps Script
The issue lies in the doOptions and doPost functions trying to use setHeader, which isn’t supported. Instead, you can set CORS headers by returning a response with the headers included in a JSON object or by using ContentService properties correctly. Below is the corrected Google Apps Script that:

Properly handles CORS for doOptions and doPost.
Saves the uploaded file to Google Drive with teamName and className in the file’s description.
Optionally logs teamName, className, filename, and timestamp to a Google Sheet (commented out, as before).
Code.gs
javascript
•
Changes to Google Apps Script
Fixed CORS Headers:
Replaced setHeader with addMetaData in both doOptions and doPost, as addMetaData is the correct method to set response headers in Google Apps Script’s ContentService.
Used setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON) in doOptions for consistency, with an empty JSON response ({ status: 'options' }).
Ensured doPost sets CORS headers for both success and error responses using addMetaData.
Team Name and Class:
Kept teamName and className handling, storing them in the file’s description (blob.setDescription).
Maintained the optional Google Sheet logging (commented out; enable by providing spreadsheetId).
Response Format:
Kept the response text as "Upload success" or "Upload failed: ..." to match your original script and client-side expectations.
Used MimeType.TEXT for compatibility with your JavaScript’s response.text() parsing.
Client-Side Code (Unchanged)
The JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from your previous setup are correct and don’t need changes, as they already send teamName and className in the payload and handle the team form. For completeness, I’ll confirm the key files:

JavaScript (script.js)
The JavaScript sends teamName and className in the payload and expects "Upload success" or "Upload failed: ..." responses, which match the updated Google Apps Script. No changes are needed:

9:48:05 AM	Error	
TypeError: ContentService.createTextOutput(...).setMimeType(...).setContent(...).addMetaData is not a function
doOptions	@ Code.gs:5
The error in your Google Apps Script execution log, TypeError: ContentService.createTextOutput(...).setMimeType(...).setContent(...).addMetaData is not a function, indicates that the addMetaData method is not available on the ContentService.TextOutput object after calling setContent. In Google Apps Script, the ContentService.createTextOutput() method chain does not support addMetaData as a method. Instead, to set response headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin for CORS, you need to use a different approach, such as setting the headers in the response object or ensuring the script is configured correctly.

This error is preventing the CORS headers from being set properly, which likely causes the fetch request from your web application (https://kean1010.github.io) to fail due to a CORS policy violation. Additionally, your previous Google Apps Script successfully saved files to Google Drive and included teamName and className in the payload, so I’ll ensure the updated script maintains this functionality while fixing the CORS issue.

Below, I’ll provide a corrected Google Apps Script that:

Properly sets CORS headers using a valid approach for doOptions and doPost.
Saves the uploaded file to your Google Drive folder (1NL52QY-oyuWgG1_ab7nrYwqwIrDMBiMF) with teamName and className in the file’s description.
Optionally logs teamName, className, filename, and timestamp to a Google Sheet (commented out, as before).
Matches your client-side JavaScript’s expected response ("Upload success" or "Upload failed: ...").
The client-side JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from your previous setup are correct and don’t need changes, as they already send teamName and className in the payload and handle the team form and progress bar. I’ll include them for completeness and confirm compatibility with the updated Google Apps Script.

Updated Google Apps Script
The issue with addMetaData stems from an incorrect assumption about ContentService’s API. Google Apps Script doesn’t provide a direct method to set custom headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin via ContentService. Instead, you can rely on the script being deployed with “Anyone, even anonymous” access, which often bypasses strict CORS checks for simple POST requests. However, to ensure CORS compatibility, you can use a workaround by returning a JSON response with CORS headers embedded in the content or use a proxy if needed. For now, I’ll simplify the script to avoid invalid methods and test if the default deployment handles CORS.

Here’s the corrected Google Apps Script:

Code.gs

Changes to Google Apps Script
Removed Invalid addMetaData:
Removed addMetaData calls in both doOptions and doPost, as they caused the TypeError.
Simplified doOptions to return an empty JSON response with MimeType.JSON to handle preflight OPTIONS requests.
Kept doPost responses as plain text ("Upload success" or "Upload failed: ...") with MimeType.TEXT to match your client-side code.
CORS Handling:
Removed explicit CORS header attempts, as Google Apps Script doesn’t support setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin directly via ContentService.
Relies on the script being deployed with “Anyone, even anonymous” access, which often allows simple POST requests to succeed without CORS issues for public web apps.
If CORS errors persist, you’ll need a proxy server (described below).
Team Name and Class:
Maintained teamName and className handling, storing them in the file’s description (blob.setDescription).
Kept the optional Google Sheet logging (commented out; enable by providing a spreadsheetId).
Client-Side Code (Unchanged)
Your JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are correct and compatible with the updated Google Apps Script. They send teamName and className in the payload, display the team form, and show a progress bar for FileReader progress. I’ll include them for completeness:

Addressing CORS
Your previous CORS error (No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header) may still occur because Google Apps Script doesn’t natively support setting CORS headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin via ContentService. However, since your original script worked (as you mentioned), it’s likely that simple POST requests from your web app were allowed when deployed with “Anyone, even anonymous” access. The updated script simplifies doOptions and doPost to avoid invalid methods, which should maintain compatibility.

If the CORS error persists (e.g., Access to fetch at ... has been blocked by CORS policy), you’ll need to set up a proxy server to add CORS headers. Here’s a quick guide to set up a proxy on Vercel:

Proxy Server Setup
Create a Proxy:
Create a new project on Vercel with this Node.js serverless function:
javascript
// api/proxy.js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  const url = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec';
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: req.method,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: req.method === 'POST' ? JSON.stringify(req.body) : undefined,
    });
    const data = await response.text();
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
    res.status(response.status).send(data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Proxy error: ' + error.message);
  }
};
Deploy on Vercel to get a URL (e.g., https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy).
Update JavaScript:
In uploadToDrive, replace the Google Apps Script URL with the proxy URL:
javascript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy',
  // ... rest of the fetch options
);
Enable Network Progress (Optional):
With a proxy, you can revert to XMLHttpRequest to track network upload progress (0–50% for FileReader, 50–100% for upload). Let me know if you want this version.
Testing Instructions
Deploy Google Apps Script:
Copy the updated Code.gs to your Google Apps Script project.
Deploy as a web app with “Anyone, even anonymous” access.
Verify the deployment URL matches https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec. If it changes, update uploadToDrive.
Test the Form:
Load the page (https://kean1010.github.io) and enter a team name (e.g., “TeamAwesome”) and class (e.g., “ClassA”).
Submit the form and confirm the map appears with the first marker.
Test Upload:
Click the Level 1 marker, upload a file (e.g., a large image or video >10MB to see progress bar updates).
Check the console for logs:
File reading progress: X%
File reading complete: Progress set to 100%
No Fetch error: ...
Verify the upload succeeds (alert: “✅ Upload successful!”) and the “Complete Level” button appears.
Check your Google Drive folder (1NL52QY-oyuWgG1_ab7nrYwqwIrDMBiMF) for the file. Right-click, view “Details,” and confirm the description includes Team: TeamAwesome, Class: ClassA.
Check Scoreboard:
After completing a level, ensure the scoreboard shows “TeamAwesome completed Level 1”.
Optional Google Sheet:
To log to a Google Sheet, create a sheet with headers Team Name, Class, File Name, Timestamp.
Get the spreadsheet ID from its URL (e.g., https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID/edit).
Uncomment the logging code in doPost, replace YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID, and redeploy.
Check the “Uploads” sheet for entries like [TeamAwesome, ClassA, Level1_TeamAwesome_ClassA_..., 2025-07-24T...].
Troubleshooting
CORS Error:
If you see Access to fetch at ... has been blocked by CORS policy, the Google Apps Script’s default CORS handling isn’t sufficient.
Set up the Vercel proxy as described and update the fetch URL.
Share the exact error message from the browser console.
Progress Bar:
The progress bar tracks FileReader progress (0–100%). Test with a large file to see updates.
If you use a proxy and want network upload progress, I can provide an XMLHttpRequest version.
Team Name and Class:
Verify the file in Google Drive has a description like Team: TeamAwesome, Class: ClassA.
If using a Google Sheet, check for logged entries.
Console Logs:
Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console).
Share logs during upload, especially any Fetch error: ... messages.
Google Apps Script:
If the script fails, check the execution log in the Google Apps Script dashboard.
Ensure the folder ID (1NL52QY-oyuWgG1_ab7nrYwqwIrDMBiMF) is valid and accessible.
Next Steps
Test the Updated Script: Deploy the new Code.gs, test the upload, and check for CORS errors.
Proxy if Needed: If CORS persists, deploy the proxy and update the fetch URL.
Network Progress: If you want the progress bar to track network uploads, confirm you’ve set up a proxy, and I’ll provide an XMLHttpRequest version.
Share Results: Provide console logs, any errors, and whether the file’s description includes teamName and className.
Let me know how it goes or if you need help with the proxy setup or additional features!

I can't click on marker to start the upload now
2 / 2
If you can’t click the marker to start the upload process, it’s likely an issue with the marker’s click event handler or the game state logic in the JavaScript code. The startLevel function, triggered when a marker is clicked, is responsible for displaying the clue box with the upload interface. Since you mentioned the upload itself worked previously but now the marker click isn’t initiating the upload process, the problem could be related to:

The marker’s click event not firing.
The startLevel function not displaying the clue box or upload interface correctly.
A game state issue (e.g., unlockedLevel or currentLevel) preventing the click from proceeding.
A JavaScript error breaking the event listener.
Given your latest Google Apps Script update resolved the addMetaData error and you’re still using the fetch-based uploadToDrive function with teamName and className integration, I’ll focus on debugging the marker click issue while ensuring the upload functionality (including the progress bar and team/class capture) remains intact. The Google Apps Script, HTML, and CSS from your previous setup should be fine, but I’ll verify the JavaScript to fix the marker issue and confirm compatibility with your server-side code.

Debugging the Marker Click Issue
The JavaScript code sets up markers with a click event that calls startLevel(level, clue). The startLevel function checks if the clicked level matches unlockedLevel and, if so, displays the clue box containing the upload input and button. If the marker isn’t responding, possible causes include:

Marker Event Not Bound: The click event listener (marker.on('click', ...)) may not be properly attached.
Game State Mismatch: The unlockedLevel condition (if (level !== unlockedLevel)) may block the click if unlockedLevel isn’t set correctly.
DOM Issue: The clue box or upload interface may not be rendering due to a missing or hidden element.
JavaScript Error: A syntax error or runtime issue could prevent the click handler from executing.
I’ll update the JavaScript to add debugging logs to the marker click and startLevel function to pinpoint the issue. I’ll also ensure the team form and upload functionality (with teamName and className) work as expected. The Google Apps Script, HTML, and CSS will remain unchanged unless the issue is related to them.

Updated JavaScript
Below is the updated JavaScript code with added debugging logs to diagnose the marker click issue. It maintains the team form, fetch-based upload with teamName and className, and the progress bar for FileReader progress (0–100%). I’ve added console.log statements to track marker creation, click events, and startLevel execution.

Testing Instructions
Deploy Google Apps Script:
Ensure the Code.gs is deployed as a web app with “Anyone, even anonymous” access.
Verify the URL matches https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec.
Test Marker Click:
Load the page (https://kean1010.github.io), submit the team form (e.g., TeamAwesome, ClassA).
Click the first marker (Level 1 at x: 1300, y: 476).
Check the console for logs:
Creating marker for Level 1 at x=1300, y=476
Marker clicked for Level 1, clue: 📚 Find the lion that guards the knowledge!
startLevel called: level=1, clue=..., unlockedLevel=1
Clue box displayed for Level 1
Confirm the clue box appears with the upload input and button.
Test Upload:
In the clue box, select a file (e.g., a large image >10MB) and click “Upload”.
Check console logs:
File reading progress: X%
File reading complete: Progress set to 100%
Sending upload request to Google Apps Script
Upload response: Upload success
Verify the alert “✅ Upload successful!” and the “Complete Level” button appears.
Check Google Drive folder (1NL52QY-oyuWgG1_ab7nrYwqwIrDMBiMF) for the file with description Team: TeamAwesome, Class: ClassA.
Check Scoreboard:
Click “Complete Level” and confirm the scoreboard shows “TeamAwesome completed Level 1”.
Debug Marker Issue:
If the marker still doesn’t respond, open the console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console).
Look for errors or missing logs (e.g., no Marker clicked for Level 1).
Check if startLevel called appears but the clue box doesn’t show, indicating a DOM issue.
Troubleshooting Marker Click
Console Logs:
If no Marker clicked for Level ... log appears, the click event isn’t firing. Verify:
The map loads correctly and the marker is visible (red pin at x: 1300, y: 476).
No JavaScript errors in the console (e.g., TypeError or ReferenceError).
The Leaflet library is loaded (https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js).
Try clicking elsewhere on the map to see if the debug Clicked Pixel Coordinates log appears.
Game State:
If you see Level 1 is locked. Current unlockedLevel: X, then unlockedLevel isn’t 1. This could happen if unlockedLevel is modified unexpectedly.
Add a debug button to reset unlockedLevel:
javascript
// Add to script.js, e.g., after team form submission
const resetBtn = document.createElement('button');
resetBtn.textContent = 'Reset Game';
resetBtn.onclick = () => {
  unlockedLevel = 1;
  currentLevel = 0;
  markers.forEach(m => map.removeLayer(m));
  markers[0].addTo(map);
  console.log('Game reset: unlockedLevel=1');
};
document.body.appendChild(resetBtn);
Add CSS for the button:
css
/* In styles.css */
#reset-btn {
  position: fixed;
  top: 10px;
  right: 10px;
}
Update HTML to include <button id="reset-btn">Reset Game</button>.
Clue Box DOM:
If Clue box elements not found appears, check the HTML for #clue-box, #clue-title, and #clue-text.
Ensure no CSS is hiding #clue-box (e.g., display: none overridden elsewhere).
CORS:
If the upload fails with a CORS error (No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header), set up the Vercel proxy as described previously and update the fetch URL.
Share the exact error message.
Team Name and Class:
Confirm the file in Google Drive has a description like Team: TeamAwesome, Class: ClassA.
If using a Google Sheet, enable logging and check entries.
Next Steps
Test the Marker: Deploy the updated script.js and test clicking the Level 1 marker. Share console logs, especially any errors or missing logs like Marker clicked for Level 1.
CORS Check: If the upload fails, check for CORS errors and consider setting up the proxy.
Reset Button: If the marker issue is due to unlockedLevel, try the reset button code above.
Progress Bar: The progress bar should work for file reading. If you want network upload progress, confirm you’ve set up a proxy, and I’ll provide an XMLHttpRequest version.
Share Details: Provide console logs, any errors, and whether the clue box appears when clicking the marker.
Let me know how it goes or if you need the proxy setup or additional debugging steps!

i get this error trying to upload.
Also can make the upload come one when the marker appear, now I have to click the marker in order for it to appear
Thank you for sharing the error details and the new requirement. Let’s address both issues:

CORS Error: The error indicates that the fetch request to your Google Apps Script (https://script.google.com/...) is being blocked because the server’s response to the preflight OPTIONS request lacks the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. This is a common issue with Google Apps Script, as it doesn’t natively support setting CORS headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin via ContentService.
Upload Interface Trigger: You want the upload interface (clue box with file input and upload button) to appear automatically when a marker appears, rather than requiring a click on the marker to trigger startLevel.
I’ll first resolve the CORS issue by providing a proxy server solution, as Google Apps Script’s limitations prevent direct CORS header configuration. Then, I’ll modify the JavaScript to show the clue box automatically when a marker is added to the map. The team name and class capture will remain integrated, and the progress bar will continue tracking FileReader progress (unless you set up the proxy, in which case I can add network upload progress).

1. Resolving the CORS Error
The error message:

text
Access to fetch at 'https://script.google.com/.../exec' from origin 'https://kean1010.github.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
indicates that the browser is sending a preflight OPTIONS request before the POST request, and Google Apps Script isn’t responding with the required Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. Your doOptions function returns a JSON response, but Google Apps Script’s ContentService doesn’t allow setting CORS headers directly, causing the browser to block the request.

Solution: Use a proxy server to forward requests to the Google Apps Script and add CORS headers. I’ll provide a Node.js serverless function for Vercel to act as the proxy. If you prefer another platform (e.g., Netlify), let me know.

Proxy Server Setup (Vercel)
Create a Vercel Project:
Create a new directory (e.g., proxy-server).
Add a file api/proxy.js with the following code:
api/proxy.js
javascript
•
Add Vercel Configuration:
Create a vercel.json file in the same directory:
vercel.json
json
•
Install Dependency:
Create a package.json file:
package.json
json
•
Run npm install to install node-fetch if testing locally.
Deploy to Vercel:
Install the Vercel CLI: npm install -g vercel.
Run vercel in the proxy-server directory to deploy.
Vercel will provide a URL (e.g., https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy).
Update JavaScript:
In script.js, replace the Google Apps Script URL with the proxy URL in the uploadToDrive function.
2. Auto-Display Clue Box When Marker Appears
To make the clue box (with the upload interface) appear automatically when a marker is added to the map, I’ll modify the JavaScript to call startLevel directly after adding a marker in two places:

After the team form submission, when the first marker is added.
In completeLevel, when the next marker is added after completing a level.
This removes the need to click the marker to show the clue box. I’ll also ensure the unlockedLevel logic prevents premature access to later levels.

Updated JavaScript
Below is the updated script.js that:

Resolves the marker click issue by ensuring events are properly bound (with debug logs retained).
Automatically shows the clue box when a marker is added.
Updates the fetch URL to use a placeholder for the proxy (replace with your Vercel URL).
Maintains teamName and className capture and the FileReader progress bar.
script.js
javascript
•
Google Apps Script (Unchanged)
Your current Google Apps Script should work with the proxy, as it correctly handles the upload and stores teamName and className in the file’s description. For reference:

Code.gs
javascript
•
HTML and CSS (Unchanged)
The HTML and CSS are correct and support the team form, clue box, and progress bar. They don’t need changes but are included for completeness:

HTML (index.html)
index.html
html
•
CSS (styles.css)

Testing Instructions
Deploy Proxy:
Follow the Vercel setup steps above to deploy the proxy server.
Replace 'https://your-proxy.vercel.app/api/proxy' in script.js with the actual Vercel URL (e.g., https://your-proxy-name.vercel.app/api/proxy).
If you use another platform (e.g., Netlify), let me know, and I’ll adjust the proxy code.
Test Auto-Display Clue Box:
Load the page (https://kean1010.github.io), submit the team form (e.g., TeamAwesome, ClassA).
Verify the map appears, the Level 1 marker is visible, and the clue box (#clue-box) automatically shows with the clue “📚 Find the lion that guards the knowledge!” and the upload interface.
Check console logs:
Team form submitted: teamName=TeamAwesome, className=ClassA
Adding first marker for Level 1 and showing clue box
startLevel called: level=1, clue=..., unlockedLevel=1
Clue box displayed for Level 1
Test Upload:
In the clue box, select a file (e.g., a large image >10MB) and click “Upload”.
Check console logs:
File reading progress: X%
File reading complete: Progress set to 100%
Sending upload request to proxy
Upload response: Upload success
Verify the alert “✅ Upload successful!” and the “Complete Level” button appears.
Check Google Drive folder (1NL52QY-oyuWgG1_ab7nrYwqwIrDMBiMF) for the file with description Team: TeamAwesome, Class: ClassA.
Test Level Progression:
Click “Complete Level” and confirm:
The clue box hides.
The scoreboard shows “TeamAwesome completed Level 1”.
The Level 2 marker appears, and the clue box automatically shows with “🕰️ Where time flows backward?”.
Check console logs:
Completing Level 1
Incremented unlockedLevel to 2
Adding marker for Level 2
Auto-showing clue box for Level 2
Debug Marker Click (Fallback):
If the clue box doesn’t appear automatically, click the marker and check for:
Marker clicked for Level 1, clue: ...
startLevel called: level=1, ...
If no logs appear, verify the Leaflet library is loaded and no JavaScript errors occur.
Troubleshooting
CORS Error:
If you see Access to fetch at ... has been blocked by CORS policy after deploying the proxy, verify the proxy URL in uploadToDrive and ensure the proxy server is running.
Share the console error for further debugging.
Clue Box Not Appearing:
If the clue box doesn’t show after form submission or level completion, check console logs for:
Clue box elements not found (indicates HTML issue).
Level X is locked (indicates unlockedLevel mismatch).
Verify #clue-box, #clue-title, and #clue-text exist in the HTML.
Marker Click:
If clicking the marker still doesn’t work, ensure the map and markers render correctly.
Check console for errors or missing logs like Marker clicked for Level ....
Progress Bar:
The progress bar tracks FileReader progress (0–100%). Test with a large file to see updates.
If you deploy the proxy and want network upload progress, I can provide an XMLHttpRequest version.
Google Drive:
Confirm files in the Google Drive folder have filenames like Level1_TeamAwesome_ClassA_... and descriptions like Team: TeamAwesome, Class: ClassA.
Next Steps
Deploy Proxy: Set up the Vercel proxy and update the fetch URL in script.js.
Test Auto-Display: Verify the clue box appears automatically after form submission and level completion.
Share Results: Provide console logs, any errors, and whether the clue box shows as expected.
Optional Enhancements:
If you want network upload progress, confirm the proxy setup, and I’ll provide an XMLHttpRequest version.
If you want to log to a Google Sheet, provide a spreadsheetId and enable the commented code in Code.gs.
Let me know how testing goes or if you need help with the proxy setup or further debugging!

i dont want to use vercel. can reset back to using simple method to upload?
I understand you want to avoid using a Vercel proxy and revert to a simpler method for uploading files to Google Drive via Google Apps Script, despite the CORS issue. Since your original Google Apps Script worked for uploads (as you mentioned it was functional before), the issue likely stems from the browser’s strict CORS enforcement when making fetch requests from https://kean1010.github.io to the Google Apps Script endpoint. Google Apps Script doesn’t support setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers, which causes the CORS error (No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header). However, a simple method that previously worked might rely on less strict CORS handling in certain browsers or configurations, or you might have tested it in a context where CORS wasn’t enforced (e.g., locally or via a form POST).

To address your request:

Revert to Simpler Upload Method: I’ll restore the original Google Apps Script and adjust the client-side JavaScript to use a method that minimizes CORS issues, such as a form-based POST or XMLHttpRequest with relaxed CORS expectations. Since your original script worked, I’ll use it as the base.
Auto-Display Clue Box: I’ll ensure the clue box (with the upload interface) appears automatically when a marker is added, as requested, removing the need to click the marker.
Maintain Team Name and Class: The script will continue capturing teamName and className in the file’s description and filename.
Progress Bar: The progress bar will track FileReader progress (0–100%), as network progress requires a proxy.
Since Google Apps Script’s CORS limitations persist, I’ll try a simpler client-side approach using XMLHttpRequest (instead of fetch), as it sometimes bypasses strict preflight checks in certain browsers. If this still triggers CORS errors, I’ll suggest an alternative like a hidden form POST or testing in a context that avoids CORS (e.g., a non-https environment or browser extensions to disable CORS checks for development). If the CORS error reappears, you may need a lightweight proxy on a platform other than Vercel (e.g., a simple Node.js server on Heroku or Glitch), but I’ll avoid proxies for now per your preference.

Updated Google Apps Script
I’ll revert to your original Google Apps Script, which you confirmed worked for uploads. It doesn’t attempt to set CORS headers (as they caused errors with setHeader and addMetaData). This script saves files to Google Drive, includes teamName and className in the file’s description, and supports optional Google Sheet logging.

Updated JavaScript
The updated script.js:

Reverts to a simpler upload method using XMLHttpRequest instead of fetch to attempt bypassing CORS preflight checks (some browsers may allow this for simple requests).

Retains teamName and className in the upload payload and filename.
Keeps the FileReader progress bar (0–100%).
Includes debug logs to verify marker and upload behavior.
script.js
javascript
Interrupted
I dont need a progress bar anymore. Please make necessary changes and revert back to simple upload method
Thank you for clarifying that you no longer need the progress bar and want to revert to a simple upload method. Since you’re avoiding a proxy (like Vercel) and want to address the CORS issue with a straightforward approach, I’ll simplify the upload process by removing the progress bar and reverting to a basic XMLHttpRequest-based upload method, which may work in some browsers despite Google Apps Script’s CORS limitations. Your original Google Apps Script worked for uploads, so I’ll keep it unchanged to maintain compatibility. Additionally, you requested that the clue box (with the upload interface) appears automatically when a marker is added, which I’ll ensure is implemented.

Addressing the CORS Issue
The CORS error (No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header) occurs because Google Apps Script doesn’t support setting CORS headers. Since your original script worked, it’s possible you tested it in a context where CORS was less strictly enforced (e.g., a non-HTTPS environment, a browser with relaxed security, or a direct form POST). Using XMLHttpRequest instead of fetch may bypass preflight OPTIONS requests in some cases, as it can be treated as a “simple request” if the headers are minimal. If CORS issues persist, I’ll suggest a fallback like a hidden form POST or testing in a development environment with CORS disabled (e.g., via a browser extension).

Changes to Implement
Remove Progress Bar: Eliminate all FileReader and progress bar code from uploadToDrive, simplifying the upload to a direct XMLHttpRequest POST.
Auto-Display Clue Box: Ensure the clue box (with upload interface) appears automatically when a marker is added (after team form submission or level completion).
Simple Upload Method: Use XMLHttpRequest to send the file as a JSON payload with teamName and className, matching your original Google Apps Script’s expectations.
Keep Google Apps Script Unchanged: Use your original script, which saves files to Google Drive with teamName and className in the description.
Maintain Team Form and Game Logic: Keep the team form, marker progression, and scoreboard functionality.
Updated Google Apps Script
Your original Google Apps Script is functional for uploads and matches the expected payload (filename, data, type, teamName, className). It saves files to the specified Google Drive folder and includes teamName and className in the file’s description. No changes are needed:

Test Level Progression:
Click “Complete Level” and confirm:
The clue box hides.
The scoreboard shows “TeamAwesome completed Level 1”.
The Level 2 marker appears, and the clue box automatically shows with “🕰️ Where time flows backward?”.
Check console logs:
Completing Level 1
Incremented unlockedLevel to 2
Adding marker for Level 2
Auto-showing clue box for Level 2
Debug CORS:
If you see a CORS error (XMLHttpRequest error: ...), try:
Testing in a browser with CORS disabled (e.g., Chrome with a CORS-disabling extension like “Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin”).
Accessing the page via http:// (not https://) if hosted locally.
Share the exact error message for further debugging.
Troubleshooting
CORS Error:
If you see XMLHttpRequest error: Network error or a CORS-related message, it’s likely the browser is enforcing CORS.
Try testing in a non-HTTPS environment (e.g., http://localhost) or use a browser extension to disable CORS for development.
If this fails, a lightweight proxy (e.g., on Glitch or Heroku) may be necessary. I can provide a simple Node.js proxy if needed.
Clue Box Not Appearing:
If the clue box doesn’t show automatically, check console logs for:
Clue box elements not found (indicates HTML issue).
Level X is locked (indicates unlockedLevel mismatch).
Verify #clue-box, #clue-title, and #clue-text in the HTML.
Upload Failure:
If the upload fails, check console logs for:
FileReader error: ...
Upload response: ...
Ensure the Google Apps Script URL is correct and the script is deployed.
Marker Issues:
If markers don’t appear, verify the Leaflet library loads and ite.png is accessible.
Check console for errors or missing logs like Creating marker for Level ....
Google Sheet Logging (Optional):
To enable logging, provide a spreadsheetId, uncomment the code in Code.gs, and redeploy.
Check the “Uploads” sheet for entries like [TeamAwesome, ClassA, Level1_..., 2025-07-24T...].
Fallback if CORS Persists
If the XMLHttpRequest approach still triggers CORS errors, consider:

Hidden Form POST: Create a hidden form to submit the data, which may avoid preflight requests:
javascript
function uploadToDrive() {
  const fileInput = document.getElementById("media-upload");
  const file = fileInput.files[0];
  if (!file) {
    alert("Please select a photo or video to upload.");
    return;
  }
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = function (e) {
    const base64Data = e.target.result.split(',')[1];
    const payload = {
      filename: `Level${currentLevel}_${teamName}_${className}_${Date.now()}_${file.name}`,
      type: file.type,
      data: base64Data,
      teamName: teamName,
      className: className,
    };
    const form = document.createElement('form');
    form.method = 'POST';
    form.action = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec';
    const input = document.createElement('input');
    input.type = 'hidden';
    input.name = 'data';
    input.value = JSON.stringify(payload);
    form.appendChild(input);
    document.body.appendChild(form);
    form.submit();
  };
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);
}
Development Environment: Test on http://localhost or disable CORS in your browser for development.
Lightweight Proxy: If needed, I can provide a simple Node.js proxy for a platform like Glitch.
Next Steps
Deploy and Test: Update script.js, index.html, and styles.css on https://kean1010.github.io. Test the auto-display of the clue box and the upload.
Check Console Logs: Open the browser console (F12) and share logs, especially for upload attempts (e.g., Upload response: ... or XMLHttpRequest error: ...).
CORS Workaround: If CORS errors occur, try the form POST approach or a browser with CORS disabled.
Share Results: Let me know if the clue box appears automatically and if uploads succeed. Provide any error messages.
If CORS issues persist or you need a proxy on another platform, let me know, and I’ll tailor the solution!

Thank you for sharing the error details. The CORS error persists with the XMLHttpRequest approach, indicating that Google Apps Script’s lack of Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers is blocking the request from https://kean1010.github.io. Since you don’t want to use a proxy like Vercel and prefer a simple upload method, I’ll explain the error, revert to an even simpler upload method using a hidden form POST (which may avoid CORS preflight checks in some cases), and ensure the clue box auto-displays when a marker appears. I’ll also maintain the team name and class capture in the file’s description and filename, as in your original setup.

Understanding the CORS Error
The error:

text
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://script.google.com/.../exec' from origin 'https://kean1010.github.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
occurs because:

CORS Policy: The browser enforces Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) when making requests from one domain (https://kean1010.github.io) to another (https://script.google.com). The server must include an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in its response to allow the request.
Preflight Request: The XMLHttpRequest with a Content-Type: application/json header triggers a preflight OPTIONS request. Your Google Apps Script’s doOptions function responds, but it doesn’t include the required Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, causing the browser to block the subsequent POST request.
Google Apps Script Limitation: Google Apps Script’s ContentService doesn’t support setting CORS headers, so the browser rejects the request.
Additional logs:

Upload response: (empty) and XMLHttpRequest error: indicate the request failed before receiving a response due to CORS.
net::ERR_FAILED confirms the request was blocked.
[Violation] 'readystatechange' handler took 1775ms and 'error' handler took 3206ms are browser warnings about slow event handlers, likely due to the failed request and error handling.
Since your original script worked, it’s possible you tested it in a context where CORS wasn’t enforced (e.g., a non-HTTPS environment, a browser with CORS disabled, or a different request method). To avoid CORS without a proxy, I’ll try a hidden form POST, which can sometimes bypass preflight checks by mimicking a simple form submission.

Simplest Upload Method: Hidden Form POST
A hidden form POST sends the data as application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data, which may avoid triggering a preflight OPTIONS request in some browsers, as these are considered “simple requests” under CORS rules. This approach submits the JSON payload as a form field, which your Google Apps Script can parse. If this still triggers CORS, you may need to test in a CORS-relaxed environment (e.g., http://localhost or a browser extension) or reconsider a lightweight proxy on a platform like Glitch.

Updated Requirements
Simple Upload: Use a hidden form POST to send the file as base64-encoded data with teamName and className.
Remove Progress Bar: Already removed in the previous response; no further changes needed.
Auto-Display Clue Box: Ensure the clue box appears when a marker is added (after team form submission or level completion).
Keep Google Apps Script: Use the existing script, which saves files to Google Drive with teamName and className.
Maintain Game Logic: Keep the team form, marker progression, and scoreboard.

Hosting the page on http://localhost instead of https://kean1010.github.io.
Share the exact error message for further debugging.
Troubleshooting
CORS Error:
If the form POST triggers a CORS error, it’s likely the browser still sent a preflight OPTIONS request. Try:
Testing on http://localhost (non-HTTPS) to bypass CORS.
Using a browser extension to disable CORS for development.
Checking if the form submission opens a new tab and completes successfully despite the error (form POSTs sometimes work but log CORS warnings).
If this fails, a lightweight proxy (e.g., on Glitch) may be the only solution. I can provide one if needed.
Form Submission Issue:
If no alert appears after form submission, check if a new tab opens with the Google Apps Script response (Upload success or Upload failed: ...).
Verify the console logs for Form response received: ....
Clue Box Not Appearing:
If the clue box doesn’t show, check console logs for:
Clue box elements not found (indicates HTML issue).
Level X is locked (indicates unlockedLevel mismatch).
Verify #clue-box, #clue-title, and #clue-text in the HTML.
Upload Failure:
If the upload fails, check console logs for FileReader error: ... or Form response received: ....
Ensure the Google Apps Script URL is correct and deployed.
Google Sheet Logging (Optional):
To enable logging, provide a spreadsheetId, uncomment the code in Code.gs, and redeploy.
Check the “Uploads” sheet for entries like [TeamAwesome, ClassA, Level1_..., 2025-07-24T...].
Fallback if CORS Persists
If the form POST still triggers CORS errors, consider:

Testing Locally: Host the site on http://localhost using a simple server (e.g., python -m http.server).
CORS-Disabling Extension: Use a browser extension to disable CORS for testing.
Lightweight Proxy: If you’re open to a proxy on a platform like Glitch (simpler than Vercel), I can provide a minimal Node.js proxy:
javascript
const express = require('express');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.options('/upload', (req, res) => {
  res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS');
  res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
  res.send();
});
app.post('/upload', async (req, res) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(req.body),
  });
  const data = await response.text();
  res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  res.send(data);
});
app.listen(3000);
Deploy this on Glitch and update form.action to the proxy URL (e.g., https://your-glitch-project.glitch.me/upload).
Next Steps
Deploy and Test: Update script.js, index.html, and styles.css on https://kean1010.github.io. Test the auto-display of the clue box and form-based upload.
Check Console Logs: Open the browser console (F12) and share logs, especially for upload attempts (e.g., Form response received: ... or any CORS errors).
CORS Workaround: If CORS errors persist, try testing on http://localhost or with a CORS-disabling extension.
Share Results: Let me know if the clue box appears automatically and if uploads succeed. Provide any error messages or console logs.
Proxy Option: If the form POST fails, confirm if you’re open to a Glitch-based proxy, and I’ll guide you through setup.
Let me know how it goes or if you need further assistance!

Upload failed: Unexpected token 'd', "data=%7B%2"... is not valid JSON
The error Upload failed: Unexpected token 'd', "data=%7B%2"... is not valid JSON indicates that the Google Apps Script is receiving the form POST data in an unexpected format, causing a JSON parsing error in the doPost function. The issue stems from the hidden form POST in script.js, which sends the JSON payload as a URL-encoded form field (data=...), but the Google Apps Script expects the raw JSON body. The %7B%2 in the error suggests URL-encoded characters (e.g., { and others), which break the JSON.parse(e.postData.contents) line in Code.gs.

Since you want a simple upload method without a proxy and prefer to avoid CORS issues, the form POST approach was an attempt to bypass preflight requests, but it’s not compatible with how doPost expects the data. The Google Apps Script’s e.postData.contents contains the form data as data={"filename":"...","type":"...","data":"...","teamName":"...","className":"..."} (URL-encoded), not raw JSON. To fix this, I’ll:

Update Google Apps Script: Modify doPost to handle form data by parsing the URL-encoded data field as JSON.
Keep Form POST in JavaScript: Retain the hidden form POST in script.js to minimize CORS issues, as it avoids preflight requests in some browsers.
Maintain Auto-Display Clue Box: Ensure the clue box (with upload interface) appears automatically when a marker is added.
No Progress Bar: Keep the progress bar removed, as per your request.
Handle CORS: If CORS issues persist, I’ll suggest testing in a CORS-relaxed environment (e.g., http://localhost or browser extension) or a lightweight proxy on a platform like Glitch.
Fixing the JSON Parsing Error
The Google Apps Script needs to extract the data field from the form submission and parse it as JSON. The form POST sends data as application/x-www-form-urlencoded (e.g., data=%7B...%7D), so doPost must decode the form data before parsing.

Updated Google Apps Script
The updated Code.gs checks if the POST data is form-encoded, extracts the data field, and parses it as JSON. This matches the hidden form POST in script.js.

JavaScript (Unchanged)
The script.js from the previous response already uses a hidden form POST, which sends the JSON payload as a data field. It also auto-displays the clue box when a marker is added. No changes are needed, but I’ll include it for completeness:

HTML and CSS (Unchanged)
The HTML and CSS are already correct, with no progress bar or loading overlay. They support the team form, map, clue box, and scoreboard.

Testing Instructions
Deploy Google Apps Script:
Update Code.gs with the new version and redeploy as a web app with “Anyone, even anonymous” access.
Verify the URL matches https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec.
Test Auto-Display Clue Box:
Load the page (https://kean1010.github.io), submit the team form (e.g., TeamAwesome, ClassA).
Verify the map appears, the Level 1 marker is visible, and the clue box automatically shows with “📚 Find the lion that guards the knowledge!” and the upload interface.
Check console logs:
Team form submitted: teamName=TeamAwesome, className=ClassA
Adding first marker for Level 1 and showing clue box
startLevel called: level=1, clue=..., unlockedLevel=1
Clue box displayed for Level 1
Test Upload:
In the clue box, select a file (e.g., an image) and click “Upload”.
The browser may open a new tab or iframe (normal for form POST). Check if it shows “Upload success” or an error.
Check console logs:
Starting upload for file: ...
Submitting form to Google Apps Script
Form response received: Upload success
Verify the alert “✅ Upload successful!” and the “Complete Level” button appears.
Check Google Drive folder (1NL52QY-oyuWgG1_ab7nrYwqwIrDMBiMF) for the file with filename like Level1_TeamAwesome_ClassA_... and description Team: TeamAwesome, Class: ClassA.
Test Level Progression:
Click “Complete Level” and confirm:
The clue box hides.
The scoreboard shows “TeamAwesome completed Level 1”.
The Level 2 marker appears, and the clue box automatically shows with “🕰️ Where time flows backward?”.
Check console logs:
Completing Level 1
Incremented unlockedLevel to 2
Adding marker for Level 2
Auto-showing clue box for Level 2
Debug CORS:
If a CORS error appears (e.g., No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header), try:
Testing on http://localhost (e.g., python -m http.server).
Using a browser extension like “Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin” for Chrome.
Checking if the form submission completes in a new tab despite CORS warnings.
Share any new error messages or console logs.
Troubleshooting
CORS Error:
If you see a CORS error, the browser is still enforcing preflight checks. Try:
Hosting on http://localhost to bypass HTTPS-related CORS restrictions.
Using a CORS-disabling browser extension for testing.
Checking if the new tab (from form submission) shows “Upload success” despite console warnings.
If CORS persists, a lightweight proxy on Glitch may be needed. I can provide setup instructions if you’re open to it.
JSON Parsing Error:
If you see Upload failed: Unexpected token..., verify the Google Apps Script deployment and ensure Code.gs matches the version above.
Check console logs for the form data being sent.
Form Submission Issue:
If no alert appears after form submission, check if a new tab opens with the response (“Upload success” or “Upload failed: ...”).
Ensure the window.addEventListener('message', ...) catches the response.
Clue Box Not Appearing:
If the clue box doesn’t show, check console logs for:
Clue box elements not found (HTML issue).
Level X is locked (unlockedLevel mismatch).
Verify #clue-box, #clue-title, and #clue-text in the HTML.
Google Sheet Logging (Optional):
To enable logging, provide a spreadsheetId, uncomment the code in Code.gs, and redeploy.
Check the “Uploads” sheet for entries like [TeamAwesome, ClassA, Level1_..., 2025-07-24T...].
Fallback if CORS Persists
If the form POST still triggers CORS errors:

Local Testing: Host the site on http://localhost using python -m http.server or a similar tool.
Browser Extension: Use a CORS-disabling extension for development.
Iframe Response Handling: Modify uploadToDrive to use an iframe for better response handling:
javascript
function uploadToDrive() {
  const fileInput = document.getElementById("media-upload");
  const file = fileInput.files[0];
  if (!file) {
    alert("Please select a photo or video to upload.");
    return;
  }
  console.log(`Starting upload for file: ${file.name}`);
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = function (e) {
    const base64Data = e.target.result.split(',')[1];
    const payload = {
      filename: `Level${currentLevel}_${teamName}_${className}_${Date.now()}_${file.name}`,
      type: file.type,
      data: base64Data,
      teamName: teamName,
      className: className,
    };
    const form = document.createElement('form');
    form.method = 'POST';
    form.action = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbya3gVaouVUDa_xL316_hwqJFuHtxCI1rJwq1U_miz4TtVsY73XGjv_GDLDFVjuo-H3MA/exec';
    form.target = 'upload_iframe';
    form.style.display = 'none';
    const input = document.createElement('input');
    input.type = 'hidden';
    input.name = 'data';
    input.value = JSON.stringify(payload);
    form.appendChild(input);
    document.body.appendChild(form);
    const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
    iframe.name = 'upload_iframe';
    iframe.style.display = 'none';
    iframe.onload = function () {
      const response = iframe.contentDocument.body.textContent;
      console.log(`Iframe response: ${response}`);
      if (response.includes("success")) {
        alert("✅ Upload successful!");
        const completeBtn = document.getElementById('complete-level-btn');
        if (completeBtn) {
          completeBtn.style.display = 'inline-block';
          console.log('Complete Level button displayed');
        }
      } else {
        alert("❌ Upload failed: " + response);
      }
      document.body.removeChild(form);
      document.body.removeChild(iframe);
    };
    document.body.appendChild(iframe);
    console.log('Submitting form to Google Apps Script');
    form.submit();
  };
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);
}
Lightweight Proxy: If all else fails, I can provide a Glitch-based proxy setup.
Next Steps
Deploy Google Apps Script: Update Code.gs and redeploy with “Anyone, even anonymous” access.
Update Files: Deploy the unchanged script.js, index.html, and styles.css to https://kean1010.github.io.
Test: Verify the clue box auto-displays and test uploads. Check for a new tab or console logs (Form response received: ...).
Share Logs: Provide console logs, especially any CORS or JSON errors, and note if the new tab shows “Upload success”.
CORS Workaround: If CORS persists, try local hosting or a CORS-disabling extension, or let me know if you’re open to a Glitch proxy.
Let me know how it goes or if you need the iframe version or proxy setup!
